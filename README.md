# Analyze A/B Test Results

by Yueh-Han Chen

## Introduction

In this project, I conducted A/B tests and regression analysis to examine the conversion rate difference in the control group and experiment group. 

## Dataset information:
This dataset is provided by Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program.

## Part A
I used 2 approaches, the P-Value method and Z-tests to conduct A/B Tests.

## Part B
I used regression to examine whether we will get the same conclusion as in Part A.

## Part C
I used multivariate regression to examine whether coutries affected conversion rate.
