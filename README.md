# Analyze A/B Test Results

by Yueh-Han Chen

## Introduction

In this project, I conducted A/B tests and regression analysis to examine the conversion rate difference between the control and experiment groups. 

## Data set information:
This data set was originally came from Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree Program.

## Part A
I used 2 approaches, the P-Value method, and Z-tests to conduct A/B Tests.

## Part B
I used regression to examine whether we would get the same conclusion as in Part A.

## Part C
I used multivariate regression to examine whether countries affected conversion rates.
